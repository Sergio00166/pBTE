python-based Basic Text Editor

A a basic terminal text editor with python using the minimun external libraries as possible (only wcwidth and colorama) 

Only supports UTF-8 (normal mode) and ASCII (for reading bin files)

Basic functionalities currently available such as copy, cut, paste lines, find string, and replaced string.
<br>Currently ctrl+Z is not available a workaround is using ctrl+a and then ctrl+b to create a .bak file

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
Python 3 (tested under python 3.12)<br>
No dependencies<br>
Windows or Linux with UTF-8 keyboard <br>

<h3>Issues</h3>
Due to limitations with msvcrt.getch() on windows to select (highlight) lines you must use Ctrl+arrows instead of Shift+arrows<br>
<b>Also in Windows all shortcuts with Alt must be instead Ctrl+Alt due to OS TTY limitations</b><br>
On linux some terminal emulators intercept Ctrl + PgUP and Ctrl + PgDown but we cannot
use Shift instead of Ctrl due to internal limitations on how the keystrokes is read. <br>
